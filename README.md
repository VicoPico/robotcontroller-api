# Robot Controller

This project is a Spring Boot application that simulates a robot navigating a grid. It provides RESTful APIs to:

- Initialize a grid (room) with specified dimensions.
- Set the robot's initial position and direction.
- Process movement commands (e.g., turn left, turn right, move forward).
- Retrieve the current state of the grid with the robot's position.

The application is designed to handle commands and render the grid state dynamically.
